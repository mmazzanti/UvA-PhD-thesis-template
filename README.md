# UvA PhD thesis template
A LaTeX template for PhD theses at the University of Amsterdam

You can see the final version of my thesis [here](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=a11af0b2-9b15-4621-82fb-87d451dd0391)

[Here]() instead a dummy template of it

## Compiling

You can just compile the main file (thesis.tex). Just opening that in TexStudio (or any similar editor) should work.

For more nerdy people there's a Makefile (never used it though, who's a programmer here...)

### Overleaf
You can also upload it on overleaf, use the following settings:

## Troubles?

Please if you see something off contact me or open an issue.
